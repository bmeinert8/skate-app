    "description": "You Are Inside Your Heart is a video portrait of Benny Urban. Benny has been out shooting for this film alongside the Vans Snow Team across Europe during the last two and a half years.\nShot on location in Norway, Finland, Austria, Slovakia, and Germany.\nFor this film we united with director Alexander Tank who’s one of Benny’s best childhood friends who was a former Snowboard Pro himself and is now a successful movie director.\nBenny: It’s been such an incredible opportunity to have had so much creative freedom on creating a film with Vans. It’s probably been the craziest two years of my life since our daughter was born right in the middle of the project. It’s the best thing that has ever happened to me and throughout this whole filming process, I was learning so much about fatherhood and simultaneously trying to power through with this project and continuing my life as a professional snowboarder.\nThe film is starring: Antti Jussila, Nils Arvidsson, Sebi Springeth, Dominik Wagner, Simon Gschaider, Jake Kuzyk, Jill Perkins, Benny Urban. Filmed by: Alex Pfeffer, Harry Hagan, Anton Kiiski, Peter Mader, Aleksi Kemiläinen, Jukka Metsäaho, Mikael Ahtikari, Robin Pailler. Directed and edited by: Alexander Tank. Music in order: \"No Excuse\" by Stalag 13, \"Mom’s Birthday\" by Max High, \"Kontrole\" by De Brassers, \"Moon 11\" by Moon B, \"Eyes won’t let me open\" by Stennes, \"Castles\" by Richard Vain.",
